  <li>Problem 1 was done during the round with the maximal score.</li>
  <li>Problem 2 seemed the most tricky (and I still feel the same, even though the actual program is easy). Didn't even think about it during the round. </li>
  <li>Problem 3 I had the algorithm that passes 1/2 test cases, but had a silly syntax error.</li>
  <li>Problem 4 also had the algorithm that passes 2/3 test cases, but submitted it 10 secs late.</li>
</ul>

This was the first Kickstart I participated in. It took me a bit longer than I expected to get accustomed to the UI, so I didn't finish most problems during the round. I am happy with it as my first round however, as realistically even with extra time spent on getting a hand on UI, I could have had 3/4 problems done. Good thing is that now I know I should set up barebones (input/output, basic libraries) for all problems in advance..
