# Google KickStart 2021e all problems with explanations in python
Solutions to all problems in the round, written in python. All solutions pass all test cases within required time limits. 
See the problems <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/round/000000000043585c">here</a>. 

For now folders contain just the code with minimal comments, I will update with the explanations shortly.

In problems 1-3 the code reads from a file "input.txt" instead of standard input for the ease of experimenting. For KickStart format, simply replace "in_f.readline()" with "input()".
